Timeline
4/7: Met up for planning and outlines, figured out the game we'll recreate, assigned roles and doing research
4/8 - 4/10: Personal planning, evaluating approaches to the project until next meet up (online or in-person)
4/11 - 4/15: Writing up skeleton code, prototyping and designing the game 
		 GOAL by 4/15: getting all pseudocode/outlining done, meet up one or twice beforehand
4/16 - 4/17: Submission to GitHub of progress on 4/16, continue to make improvements and refinements, headstart on actual coding and UI
4/18 - 4/22: Coding the project, testing the project, debugging the project, overall getting the game to work almost exactly like the original
		 GOAL by 4/22: Major functions of the game up and running (guessing, random word generator, showing correct letters, etc), 
				   if major functions are not working, overtime on the weekend is needed (work will most likely bleed into next week)
		 		   Meeting up once or twice within the week, maybe more depending on progress speed
4/23 - 4/24: Submission to GitHub of progress on 4/23, continue to make improvements and refinements, planning small visual details
4/25 - 4/27: Refining the project, adding more details, final debugs and modifications
		 GOAL by 4/27: Getting as much tests done as possible to ensure game quality and functions are properly working
				   Meeting up as much as possible until this is polished (as much as it can be)
4/28: Final adjustments, details, improvements, etc; Final submission to GitHub before on 4/28 11:59pm
