Today's Discussion (4/25/22):
-Logic testing working where the client never receives the word
-Server is fully functional and does all of the thinking
-Client sends a guess, server sends back a string of numbers
	-This tell the client which letters where right, wrong, or misplaced
	-Also prevents client side cheating, allows the server to do everything
-Fixed UI and details such as colors and formatting
